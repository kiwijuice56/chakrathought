	<p>You read that title right: summer snails are the HOTTEST new trend to compliment your beach bod while you sip your piña colada in the beaches of Cancún! You might imagine snails as the useless critters that ruin your perfect garden of invasive herbs and flowers, but you’d be missing out without a pet snail. </p>

	Snails serve the vital function of maintaining their ecosystems, recycling the energy of decaying organisms back into the environment and providing for new life over countless millennia. If you are like us at ChakraThought, we know what you must be thinking: How can we ever hope to feel as necessary and desirable as a snail is to nature?! Fret not dear reader, because this list (compiled by a research team at the Caltech department of theology) is guaranteed to transform you from a lingering laggard to the most sizzling slug straggler on your feed!
