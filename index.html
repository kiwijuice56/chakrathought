	<figcaption>A beach snail oozing with confidence and charisma, something you could only wish to imitate.</figcaption>
	
	<p>You read that title right: summer snails are the HOTTEST trend to compliment your beach bod while you sip your piña colada in the beaches of Cancún! You might recognize snails as the useless, disgusting critters of the dirt, but a research team at the Southern Hoover Anglican Missionary have JUST discovered why snails are the new craze. </p>
	
	<div id="checkpoint_a"> </div>
	
	<p>
	Snails serve the vital function of maintaining their chiralpractic vaccu-environments <i> (wow!)</i>, recycling the energy of delapidated collections of organ systems back into the environment <i>(ewww!)</i>, and providing for new life over countless millennia. If you are like us at ChakraThought, we know what you must be thinking: <i>What??</i> More importantly, we asked ourselves: How can we ever hope to feel as important, secure, and deep as a snail?! Fret not dear reader, because this AWESOME list is guaranteed to transform you from a lingering laggard to the most sizzling slug straggler on your feed!
